# CS112 - Data Structures
Assignments I worked on for my CS112 course at Rutgers.

Big Integer - Assignment on linked lists. Write a program that treats linked lists of digits as if they were integers and can run mathematical operations (addition, multiplication
, subtraction) on two lists. 
Eg: [1] -> [2] -> [1]
  * [4] -> [2] -> [2]

Trie - Assignment on Tree structures. Write a program that takes in a list of words and categorizes them in a tree based structure based on shared substrings.
Eg:   do
     /  \
   dog  door
   
Friends - Assignment on graph structures. Write a program that takes in an input of the names of students and their schools along with their friends. Generate a graph that connects
students based on their friends and write functions that can find paths between friend connections or group friends within schools.
Eg:   Bill-Rutgers  <--> Sydney-Rutgers <-->  Rob-Princeton
          ^                    ^
          |                    |
          v                    v
      Phil-Rutgers <--> Jon-Rutgers

Expression - Assignment on stacks/queues. Write a program that takes in an input of a mathematical equation, parse the equation then solve it. Also be able to handle array 
structures and other specified mathematical functions.  
Eg: Input: a = 2, b = 3, c = 2, [b+a]*c
